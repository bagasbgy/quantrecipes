\title{Calculate cumulative returns based on specified actions}
\usage{
step_cumret(recipe, ..., prices, fee = 0.001, mult = FALSE,
  prefix = "cumret", actions = NULL, role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE, skip = FALSE, id = rand_id("cumret"))

\method{tidy}{step_cumret}(x, info = "terms", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables are affected by the step. See
\link[recipes:selections]{selections (from recipes package)} for more details.}

\item{prices}{in development.}

\item{fee}{in development.}

\item{mult}{in development.}

\item{prefix}{A \code{character} vector of length one that would be used
as a prefix to the created columns.}

\item{actions}{A container for selected actions columns. Leave to \code{NULL}
as it will be populated by \link[recipes:prep.recipe]{prep()} function.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis
role should they be assigned? By default, the function assumes
that the created columns will be used
as \code{"predictors"} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the necessary informations for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \link[recipes:bake.recipe]{bake()}? While all operations are baked
when \link[recipes:prep.recipe]{prep()} is run, some operations may not
be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing
the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE}
as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A \code{step_cumret} object.}

\item{info}{Options for \code{tidy()} method; whether to return tidied
information for used \code{"terms"} or \code{"params"}}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any).
}
\description{
\code{step_cumret} creates a \strong{specification} of a recipe
step that will calculate \strong{cumulative returns} from a set of strategy
actions and historical prices.
